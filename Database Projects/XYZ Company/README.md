This project involved the end-to-end design, implementation, and population of a comprehensive relational database for a simulated company. The schema was carefully structured to support a wide range of business functions, including employee management, job applications, interviews, product-part tracking, vendor pricing, customer sales, and shift scheduling. 

<br> <br> Key challenges included maintaining normalization while handling complex relationships such as recursive supervisor assignments, multi-stage interview evaluation, composite primary keys across operational tables, and creating fairly complex queries and views. Using Python and the Faker library, I generated thousands of realistic, constraint-respecting records, and overcame issues related to profitability logic, referential integrity, and diagramming limitations in Word in the Relational Schema. 
	
<br> <br> Through this experience, I deepened my understanding of database design, functional dependencies, normalization up to 3NF, and the practical application of SQL constraints, views, and data modeling principles at scale. This project reflects not only technical capability but also the ability to model real-world business rules with data integrity and clarity.
